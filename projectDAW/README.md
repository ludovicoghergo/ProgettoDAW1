# Project DAW 1

Welcome in the page of Project DAW1

## Wait, what's this?

Project DAW1 is a project developed by a team of 4 students of the university of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.
It's about developing a website using the main strategies for team-working and designing.

### What's our language?
We're coding the website using
  * HTML&Bootstrap (for pages and layouts)
  * JavaScript (in future)
  * JQuery
  * Ruby & Rails

### Bootstrap

## Why using it?

We think that bootstrap it's a safer and faster way to develop a website page layout.
In Bootstrap indeed you don't need the 'css file' because you can use the standard class offered by it.
Let's see an example:
**HTML:**
```
<div style="background-color:red;height=100%;"></div>
```
**HTML&Bootstrap:**
```
<div class="bg-red h-100"></div>
```

## What i should know before read the code?
It's  higly recommendend to know at least the meaning of html's tags and the basics of bootstrap components:
 * **Cards**
 * **Wrappers**
 * **Containers**
 * **Nav**
Also is good but not necessary (IMO) know the css standard options.

### Updates
We're going to improve the website to be ready for Sprint 2, and that means that we'll implement **JQuery**,**Ruby&rails**,**SQL** and connections with servers.
